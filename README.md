#### BTCPay URL

In the BTCPay URL field of your nopCommerce, simply input the link to your self-hosted server or the one hosted by a [third-party provider](https://directory.btcpayserver.org/filter/hosts). For example; https://mainnet.demo.btcpayserver.org

#### BTCPay Store ID

BTCPay **Store ID** can be obtained from your BTCPay Server, in Store Settings > General > Store ID field. Copy it and paste it over in the `BTCPay Store ID` field.
